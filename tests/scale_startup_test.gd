## Startup test for the world-scale experiment scene (scale_test.tscn).
##
## Same contract as world_startup_test.gd but at 8×: the upscaled starter
## must boot playable — you spawn as a (now 8-cell-tall) person beside the
## helm, can take it, and the physics stays calm. This is the gate that
## lets the owner's feel test start at "does it fly" instead of "does it
## boot".
